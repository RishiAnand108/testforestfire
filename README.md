# testforestfire

## Overview
This project contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing and testing forest fire data. The primary goal is to explore data patterns, apply relevant machine learning models, and gain insights for forest fire prediction or assessment.

## Repository Contents
- **Notebook.ipynb:** Main Jupyter Notebook file where data analysis, processing, and modeling are conducted.

## Features
- Data exploration and visualization
- Machine learning model implementation for forest fire data
- Insights and potential predictions based on the data

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, seaborn (install via pip)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository
   git clone https://github.com/RishiAnand108/testforestfire.git

2. Navigate to the project directory
   cd testforestfire
   
3. Install required libraries
   pip install -r requirements.txt

(Create a `requirements.txt` with the libraries if not yet present)

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook
    jupyter notebook


## Usage
- Open the notebook file in Jupyter
- Run cells sequentially to perform data loading, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation
- Modify or extend the notebook to try new models or deeper analysis
